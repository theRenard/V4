# V4

A fucking boilerplate with just:

1. fucking Parcel
2. fucking TypeScript 4
3. fucking Scss
4. fucking eslint

No fucking React or fucking Vue or fucking Angular or fucking Svelte or some fucking francy framework.

No fucking unit tests, no fucking e2e tests, just two fucking scripts:

1. fucking `npm start` to start your shit
2. fucking `npm run build` to build your shit

If you fucking want to publish your fucking page on fucking gitlab there's a fucking CI that takes care of it.

That's all. Fuck.
